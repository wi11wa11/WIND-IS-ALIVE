What you need
WIND IS REAL program files
P5.serial applet OPEN in background
Anemometer Arduino code
Anemometer Arduino circuit
To run WIND IS ALIVE you need to open the program code in a Chrome browser. This is to allow p5.serial to communicate properly.

Steps:
-	Open sketch in CHROME p5.js 
-	Open p5.serial applet
-	Connect Arduino to computer
-	Open relevant Arduino serial port in p5.serial
-	Run sketch
-	Check to make sure Arduino is connected in the console 
-	when the anemometer is spun a red dot will print in the top left hand corner as well as the latest data values printed in the console
-	Interact and enjoy!
