# WIND-IS-ALIVE
anemometer operated interactive particle systems


README
What you need
WIND IS REAL program files
P5.serial applet OPEN in background
Anemometer Arduino code
Anemometer Arduino circuit
To run WIND IS ALIVE you need to open the program code in a Chrome browser. This is to allow p5.serial to communicate properly.

Sketch: https://editor.p5js.org/willwall/sketches/_wwve68ah

Github repository: https://github.com/wi11wa11/WIND-IS-ALIVE 

P5.serial: https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport 

Steps:
-	Open sketch in CHROME p5.js 
-	Open p5.serial applet
-	Connect Arduino to computer
-	Open relevant Arduino serial port in p5.serial
-	Run sketch
-	Check to make sure Arduino is connected in the console 
-	when the anemometer is spun a red dot will print in the top left hand corner as well as the latest data values printed in the console
-	Interact and enjoy!


OPTIONS FOR WITHOUT ARDUINO
If you do not have Arduino hardware to connect, do not fear!
The sketch should still run in p5.js without p5.serial or Arduino
To interact, use “a” and “d” to manipulate particle systems within game modes and the rain
Use LEFT_KEY and RIGHT_KEY to manipulate the video tiles
